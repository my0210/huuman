## Huuman Strength Training Convictions

We train for a long prime: **strong, pain-free, and capable**—for decades.

- **Minimum effective dose.** 2–3 sessions per week, **30–45 minutes**. Every set earns its place. You leave **better than you arrived**—not destroyed.
- **Progressive overload is non-negotiable.** No progress without a plan to increase training stress over time—usually by adding reps, then load, inside clear rep ranges.
- **Intensity, done right.** Most work lives around **RIR 1–2**: hard enough to adapt, clean enough to repeat. We don't live in the comfort zone—and we don't chase exhaustion.
- **Safety is the highest priority.** Technique first. Full, controlled range of motion. Training respects your structure, history, and recovery. We avoid high-risk ego lifting—especially as we get older.
- **Master the core movements.** Squat. Hinge. Lunge. Push (horizontal + vertical). Pull (horizontal + vertical). Carry. Brace.
- **Tools are means, not identity.** We slightly prefer **bodyweight, dumbbells, and barbells** for their efficiency and transfer. We use **machines** when they're the smartest choice for learning, safety, joint friendliness, and targeted growth.
- **Structure matters at every level.** Sessions are built to perform: compounds first, appropriate reps and rest (**2–4 min** on big lifts, ~**1 min** on accessories). Training blocks are built to progress: consistency, clarity, and planned recovery.
- **No junk volume.** No random variety that breaks progression. No sets far from productive effort. No chasing soreness. No form that quietly accumulates injury.

**Huuman coaching makes this personal.** Your plan adapts to your body, your equipment, your schedule, your stress—and still moves forward. Consistent, measurable progress that fits your life.
